##1
Some Fake Data about some purchases done through Amazon can be found in the Economics Purchases file
The Lab 1_Economic Purchases notebook or python file reads the dataset and seeks to answers certain questions using the dataset provided.
Please excuse anything that doesn't make "Real-World" sense in the dataframe, all the data is fake and made-up.

##2 Lab 1_Numy_Exercise notebook or python explores certain numpy methods that will be relevant in my Machine Learning Course I am taking this Spring semester.

##3 Salaries.csv is also a dataset obtained from Kaggle. Lab 1_Salaries notebook or python file reads the dataset and explores the use of pandas, in answering questions from the dataset.

NB: The notebooks can be run via Google Colab or Jupiter Notebook. Their respective python files are also available.
